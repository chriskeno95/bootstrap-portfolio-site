# bootstrap-portfolio-site

## Description 

This is my personal porfolio that i have created for the third  week of the front end web development bootcamp course. I have combined what i have been learning for the past 3 weeks into this project. For this project i have created it with bootstrap to minimise the media queries and to achieve a resposive portfolio that is viewable across multiple screen sizes. I have decided for this project that in would build upon the design i used for my porfolio in week 3 but to add more sections such as an about me section and skills section etc. I will base the design on the first hi-fi wireframe i created and create a new low-fi wireframe for this project to map out layout.

Through the process of this project, i have learned more anout bootstrap and how to works; During the classes i was pretty confused and slow to pick it up, however after completing this project i have a better understanding of how it works. I am still quite slow at using bootstrap but i hope to improve the more i practice.

For this project, as i created a slightly harder design (i wanted to push myself by creating something that i didnt know how to make so that i could problem solve) i found that bootstrap didnt work too well with the responsivness of the site and i had to use more media queries than i probably should. This is something i can work on again in future projects as i mostly just need to rethink and plan how the page structure will actually work.


While completing this project i struggled with the responsiveness of the webpage while using bootstrap and this is something i will work on as the bootcamp progresses; i will practice bootstrap on simpler layouts so that i can practice this more. I also completed this projects with more div elements that i would like, this was mostly out of trying to code quickly. I will do a code refractory on this project in the future and definately for my final portfolio project.

Here is the wireframe that i created as a visual aid while completing my last project, i have used this as a guide for this project. I have also created a low-fi box wireframe to map out where content will be for this project.
